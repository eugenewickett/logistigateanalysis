    This function/script uses randomly generated systems to test different sampling
    policies' ability to form inferences on entities in the system.
    The goal is to understand the space with respect to SFP manifestation. This goal is
    measured by the average 90% interval size of each entity's inferred SFP rate.

    For each generated supply-chain system, samples are collected according to the
    sampling policy according to a set batch size. Once each batch is collected, all
    samples collected to that point are used to generate MCMC samples. The intervals
    formed by these samples are measured, recorded, and the next batch of samples is
    collected.
